# Project_file-01

Hello, world and welcome!

Behold, This is a file full of my first sets of project in my journey learning to become a full-stack web developer. Please use this as a portfolio to see how I have progressed, but first a little introduction. 

My name is RobSm!th, and I live in the desert. Yes... The hot, hot sand! I am a big nerd and I'm well past my first year in learning web development and have entered my second year. I feel I have a strong understanding of HTML and CSS. I've just recently started learning JavaScript/JQuery and I feel very comfortable using Twitter's Bootstrap. I am also currently learning how to use CSS Grid in place of.
 

If you are someone who is interested in getting ahold of me or are interested in working with me then please email me at whiskey.tango.foxx1809@gmail.com
